This repo includes the completed tasks for stage one, two and three of the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Restaurant Reviews nanodegree project.

### I have a live demo of the project on netlify which can be viewed [here](https://sharp-brown-2c2431.netlify.com/). I have cloned the development server to Glitch.com to work with the demo.
